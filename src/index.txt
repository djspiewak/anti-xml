Anti-XML is a proposed replacement for the ``scala.xml`` package in
the Scala standard library.

The standard package is outdated and beyond fixing.  We need to start
over, on solid foundations and unburdened by backward compatibility.

Anti-XML aims for quality in three major areas:

* **Usability**

  * Leverage powerful ideas like combinators and proper ADT_ s
  * Leverage the 2.8 collections library
  * Provide consistent selector behavior
  * Avoid these missteps: ``Node <: NodeSeq <: Seq[Node]``,
    ``MetaData``, ``Atom[String]``

* **Reliability**

  * Use immutable data structures (in the API and under the hood too)
  * Avoid bugs and race conditions
  * Provide a proper ``equals``
  
* **Performance**

  * Lower memory usage (`Novell Vibe`_ once had a 16 MB chunk of XML
    use 250 MB of heap!)
  * Provide efficient selectors

We are exploring `many ideas`_ for this project. It will be
interesting to see where things go!
