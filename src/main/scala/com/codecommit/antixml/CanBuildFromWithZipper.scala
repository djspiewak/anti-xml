/** A factory for [[com.codecommit.antixml.Zipper]] instances. 
 *
 * WARNING: This is a "low-level" trait that was primarily designed for internal
 * use of the antixml package.  It is tied to the `Zipper` implementation and
 * could change significantly in a future release.
 *
 * This trait is similar to 
 * [[http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/generic/CanBuildFrom.html CanBuildFrom]], 
 * except that it allows a zipper context to be specified in addition to the usual sequence of items.
 * See the [[com.codecommit.antixml.Zipper]] trait for the definition of "zipper context".
 *
 * The [[http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/mutable/Builder.html Builder]] produced 
 * by this class accepts objects of type
 * [[com.codecommit.antixml.CanBuildFromWithZipper.ElemsWithContext]]. These objects
 * contain the following information:
 *  - A sequence of items (nodes) to be added to the zipper.
 *  - A path specifying the hole associated with the above items.
 *  - An update counter, which indicates the relative order in which the zipper's items were last
 * updated.  This information is used by some [[com.codecommit.antixml.ZipperMergeStrategy]] 
 * implementations when resolving conflicts.
 * 
 * Note that an `ElemsWithContext` may contain an empty sequence, in which case its path (hole)
 * is added to zipper context without being associated to any items. Also note that it is legal for 
 * the same path (hole) to be added to the Builder multiple times.  The resulting Zipper 
 * will associate ''all'' of the corresponding items to that hole. 
 *
 * The parent of the zipper context is specified to the `apply` method of this trait.
 *
 * @tparam From The type of collection that is producing the zipper.
 * @tparam Elem The type of nodes to be contained in the result (if any).
 * @tparam To the type of collection being produced.  
 * @see [[com.codecommit.antixml.Zipper]]
