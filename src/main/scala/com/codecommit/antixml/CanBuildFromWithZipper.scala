 * functionality (producing an instanceof [[scala.collection.mutable.Builder]])
 * with respect to a provided zipper context, this typeclass also provides a
 * monoidal append method on the `To` type.   This is required for deep-select on
 * [[com.codecommit.antixml.Group]].
 *
 * A default implicit "lifting" is provided from [[scala.collection.generic.CanBuildFrom]] to
 * an instances of [[com.codecommit.antixml.CanBuildFromWithZipper]] for all target
 * types which are implicitly convertable to [[scala.collection.Traversable]].
 * (the reason for this restriction is to allow a default implementation of the
 * aforementioned monoidal append)  This implicit lifting is defined in the
 * companion object for this trait, giving it lower priority in the implicit
 * resolution, but still accessible without requiring an explicit import.
