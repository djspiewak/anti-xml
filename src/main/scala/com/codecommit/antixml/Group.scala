/**
 * Represents a collection of arbitrary nodes ([[com.codecommit.antixml.Node]])).
 * Note that this collection need not have a single root parent element.  Thus,
 * a valid `Group` could be as follows:
 *
 * {{{
 * Group(EntityRef("quot"), Text("Daniel is "), Elem(None, "em", Attributes(), Map(), Group(Text("delusional!"))), EntityRef("quot"))
 * }}}
 *
 * This would correspond to the following XML fragment (note: not actually well-formed
 * XML, since it is lacking a single root element):
 * 
 * {{{
 * &quot;Daniel is <em>delusional!</em>&quot;
 * }}}
 *
 * Note that unlike `scala.xml`, `Group` is ''not'' a special type of [[com.codecommit.antixml.Node]]!
 * This design decision has a very profound impact on the framework as a whole.
 * In general, the result is an API which is more consistent and more predictable
 * than it otherwise would have been.  However, it also resulted in some unfortunate
 * sacrifices: specifically, full XPath semantics.  The exact semantics of the
 * `\` and `\\` operators are defined in their respective scaladocs.
 * 
 * `Group` is parameterized based on the type of `Node` it contains.  In the
 * general case (such as the one illustrated above), this will be exactly `Node`.
 * However, there are some very common cases wherein a `Group` may have a more
 * specific type than just `Node`.  For example:
 *
 * {{{
 * val ns: Group[Node] = ...
 * val results = ns \ "name"
 * }}}
 *
 * In this example, `results` will have type `Group[Elem]`.  This is because the
 * selector employed (`"name"`) can ''only'' produce results of type `Elem`.  This
 * mechanism forms the basis for the typed selectors mechanism, which is extremely
 * powerful and serves to eliminate a great deal of boiler-plate casting when
 * traversing XML hierarchies.
 *
 * In the general case, `Group` is backed by an instance of [[scala.collection.immutable.Vector]].
 * This implementation detail is significant as it implies two things.  First,
 * the implementation of `Group` is truly immutable, meaning that there are no
 * tricky concurrency semantics to worry about.  Second, unlike `scala.xml` (which
 * backs its sequences by either `List` or `ArrayBuffer`, depending on phase of
 * the moon), it is possible to perform ''efficient'' random-access and updates
 * across the entire `Group`.  Random access is implemented by the `apply` method,
 * while random "updates" are implemented by the `updated` method.  Fast prepend
 * and append operations are also available.
 *
 * Beyond this, all standard collection operations are available on `Group` (e.g.
 * `flatMap`, `exists`, `collect`, `slice`, etc).  The appropriate incantations
 * have been spoken to allow these methods to return the correct type.  Thus, if
 * you `map` over a `Group` and your function returns something which extends
 * `Node`, the result will be a `Group`.  If your function returns something which
 * does ''not'' extend `Node` (e.g. `Int`), then the result will be something
 * else (probably a generic `IndexedSeq` backed by `Vector`).  `Group` itself
 * extends [[scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq]] and thus can be used in
 * situations which require this abstraction.

  /**
   * Merges adjacent [[com.codecommit.antixml.Text]] as well as adjacent
   * [[com.codecommit.antixml.CDATA]] nodes to produce a `Group` which represents
   * an identical XML fragment but with a minimized structure.  Slightly more
   * formally, for any XML fragment with ''n'' characters of textual data, there
   * are ''2^n^'' possible ways of representing that fragment as a `Group`.  All
   * of these representations are semantically distinct (i.e. structurally different
   * in memory) but logically equivalent in that they will all generate the same
   * XML fragment if serialized.  Of these ''2^n^'' distinct representations,
   * there will be exactly one representation which is ''minimal'', in that the
   * smallest possible number
   * of [[com.codecommit.antixml.Text]] and [[com.codecommit.antixml.CDATA]] nodes
   * are used to represent the textual data.  This form may be considered
   * "canonical".  This method converts an arbitrary `Group` into its canonical
   * form, a ''logically'' equivalent `Group` which represents the same XML fragment
   * in its structurally minimized form.
   * 
   * This method is perhaps best explained by an example:
   *
   * {{{
   * val xml = Group(Text("Daniel "), Text("Spiewak"))
   * xml.canonicalize    // => Group(Text("Daniel Spiewak"))
   * }}}
   *
   * The `Group` resulting from the `canonicalize` invocation will produce exactly
   * the same result as would `xml` were we to invoke the `toString` method on
   * each of them.  However, the canonicalized result has only one text node for
   * the entire character block, while `xml` (the original `Group`) has two.
   *
   * This is actually a very common gotcha in `scala.xml`.  The issue comes up
   * most frequently in the area of equality.  As you can see in the example above,
   * `xml` ''clearly'' will not be equivalent (according to the `equals` method)
   * to `xml.canonicalize`.  However, it is very natural to assume that these
   * two structures are in fact equal due to their ''logical'' equivalence in
   * that they represent the same textual XML fragment.  Oftentimes, people will
   * get around this issue in `scala.xml` by converting all `NodeSeq`(s) into
   * strings prior to comparison.  In Anti-XML, all that is necessary to handle
   * potential semantic divergence in cases of logical equality is to simply
   * invoke the `canonicalize` method on each of the two equality operands.
