 * a result.  This is the handler which is used internally by [[com.codecommit.antixml.SAXParser]].
 * It is provided as part of the public API to allow Anti-XML to be used with
 * alternative SAX2 event sources (such as HTML parsers like TagSoup).  The
 * resulting [[com.codecommit.antixml.Group]] is obtained (at the conclusion of
 * the parse) from the `result()` method.
