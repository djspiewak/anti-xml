trait Selectable[+A <: Node] {
  
  /**
   * Performs a shallow-select on the XML tree according to the specified selector
   * function.  Shallow selection is defined according to the following expression:
   *
   * {{{
   * nodes flatMap {
   *   case Elem(_, _, children) => children collect selector
   *   case _ => Group()
   * }
   * }}}
   *
   * In English, this means that a shallow selection works by first selecting
   * ''only'' the [[com.codecommit.antixml.Elem]](s) at the top level and then
   * filtering their children according to the selector.  The results of these
   * filtrations are concatenated together, producing a single flattened result.
   *
   * '''Very important:''' This is ''not'' the same as the XPath `/` operator!
   * (nor does it strive to be)  XPath is inconsistent in its selection semantics,
   * varying them slightly depending on whether or not you are selecting from
   * the top level or in the middle of a compound expression.  As a result, it
   * is categorically ''impossible'' to implement XPath in a combinatorial
   * fashion.  Rather than give up on combinators, we chose to give up on XPath.
   * In practice, this "select child `Elem`(s), then filter their children" behavior
   * tends to be the most useful variant of the XPath selection.  The "missed"
   * case here is applying a filter to the top-level set of nodes.  This is
   * currently not handled by the API (perhaps in future).  For now, if you need
   * this functionality, it's pretty easy to get it using the `filter` method.
   * 
   * The results of this function will be a collection of some variety, but the
   * exact type is determined by the selector itself.  For example:
   *
   * {{{
   * val ns: Group[Node] = ...
   * ns \ "name"
   * ns \ *
   * ns \ text
   * }}}
   *
   * The three selection expressions here produce very different results.  The
   * first will produce a collection of type [[com.codecommit.antixml.Zipper]]`[`[[com.codecommit.antixml.Elem]]`]`,
   * the second will produce [[com.codecommit.antixml.Zipper]]`[`[[com.codecommit.antixml.Node]]`]`,
   * while the third will produce [[scala.collection.Traversable]]`[`[[scala.String]]`]`.
   * This reflects the fact that the selector produced (by implicit conversion)
   * from a `String` will only filter for nodes of type [[com.codecommit.antixml.Elem]].
   * However, the `*` selector will filter for ''all'' nodes (as the wildcard
   * symbol would suggest) and thus it must return a collection containing the
   * fully-generic [[com.codecommit.antixml.Node]].  Finally, the `text` selector
   * specifically pulls out the textual contents of nodes, and thus its results
   * will not be nodes at all, but raw `String`(s).
   *
   * Whenever supported by the resulting collection type, the selection operation
   * will preserve a "backtrace", or an "undo log" of sorts.  This backtrace is
   * known as a zipper context.  This context makes it possible to operate on
   * the collection resulting from performing a selection, then ''unselect'' to
   * rebuild the original collection around it (modulo the changes made).  This
   * provides a very clean and powerful way of drilling down into an XML tree,
   * making some changes and then realizing those changes within the context of
   * the full tree.  In a sense, it solves the major inconvenience associated
   * with immutable tree structures: the need to manually rebuild the entire
   * ancestry of the tree after making a change somewhere within.
   *

   * Performs a deep-select on the XML tree according to the specified selector

   *   case Elem(_, _, _, children) => children \\ selector
   *   case _ => Group()
   * }
   * 
   * (this \ selector) ++ recursive
   * }}}
   *
   * In English, this means that deep selection is defined simply as the recursive
   * application of shallow selection (`\`), all the way from the root down to the
   * leaves.  Note that the recursion does not short circuit when a result is
   * found.  Thus, if a parent node matches the selector as well as one of its
   * children, then both the parent ''and'' the child will be returned, with the
   * parent preceeding the child in the results.
   *
   * Just as with shallow selection, the very outermost level of the group is not
   * considered in the selection.  Thus, deep selection is not ''exactly'' the
   * same as the XPath `//` operator, since `//` will consider the outermost level,
   * while Anti-XML's deep selection `\\` will not.
   *
   * '''Note:''' For certain selectors (such as an element name selector defined
   * using a `String` or `Symbol`), the result of this method will be a zipper,
   * similar to the results from the shallow-select operator (`\`).  This zipper
   * will ''not'' be valid!  Zipper context synthesis for deep selection is
   * currently unimplemented.  Thus, any attempt to use the `unselect` method on
   * the resulting zipper will likely throw an exception.  At the very least, it
   * won't return a useful result.  The implementation of this feature is ongoing.

   * as a child of a node in the result set.  For the purpose of this discussion, 
   * a result set with this property is said to be ''topologically consistent'' with the original
   * XML tree.  
   *
   * As with the '\', and '\^' operators, backtrace ("zipper") operations are fully supported.  Indeed,
   * backtrace support is a major advantage of topological consistency.  Without this property,
   * backtracing semmantics must provide some means of resolving conflicting updates to nodes that
   * appear in multiple localations of the result set.
   *
