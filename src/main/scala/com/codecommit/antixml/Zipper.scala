/** 
 * Provides an `unselect` operation which copies this Group's nodes back to the XML tree from which
 * it was derived.See the [[http://anti-xml.org/zippers.html Anti-XML Overview]] for a 
 * high-level description of this functionality.  
 *
 * The `Zipper` trait augments a [[com.codecommit.antixml.Group]] with additional immutable state used 
 * to support the `unselect` method.  This state is known as the "zipper context" and is defined by:
 *  - A reference to another `Group`, known as the ''parent'' of the Zipper.
 *  - A set of (possibly deep) locations within the parent, known  
 *  as the ''holes'' of the Zipper.
 *  - A mapping from the top-level indices of the Zipper to its holes, known as
 *  the Zipper's ''replacement map'' 
 * 
 * Loosely speaking, the `unselect` method produces an updated version of the 
 * parent by replacing its holes with the nodes from the Zipper, as determined by the replacement map.
 * A formal definition of `unselect` can be found below.
 * 
 * Certain "modify" operations on a `Zipper` will propagate the zipper context to the result.
 * The new Zipper's `unselect` method can then be viewed as applying
 * these modifications back to the parent tree.  Currently, the following methods 
 * support this propagation of the zipper context:
 *   - `updated`, `map`, `flatMap`, `filter`, `collect`, `slice`, `drop`, `take`, `splitAt`, and
 * `unselect` (the latter viewed as a modification of the parent `Zipper`). 
 *
 * These operations all provide a natural identification of indices in the new Zipper with
 * the indices they were derived from in the original.  This identification is used to lift
 * the replacement map to the new Zipper.  The parent and holes of the new Zipper are always the same
 * as those of the original.
 *
 * Of course, propagation is only possible if the result can legally be a `Zipper`.  Replacing a `Node`
 * with a `String`, for example, will result in an undecorated `IndexedSeq` because the result violates
 * Zipper's type bounds.
 *
 * ==== Node Multiplication and Elision ====
 *
 * A Zipper's replacement map need neither be injective nor surjective.  
 * Injectivity can fail due to the action of `flatMap`, which replaces a node with a sequence of nodes, 
 * all of which are associated with the original node's hole. In such cases, `unselect` will replace the hole with the 
 * entire sequence of nodes mapping to it.  Surjectivity can fail due to any operation that "removes" items 
 * from the `Zipper`.  If a hole is not associated with any Zipper nodes, then `unselect` will remove that position
 * from the resulting tree.
 *
 * ==== Conflicting Holes ====
 *
 * For a given Zipper, a hole, H, is said to be ''conflicted'' if the Zipper contains another hole,
 * H,,c,, , contained in the subtree at H.  In this case, the Zipper is said to be
 * ''conflicted at'' H.  A Zipper that does not contain conflicted holes is said to be ''conflict free''. 
 * Conflicted holes arise when a selection operator yields both a node and one or more of its descendants.
 * They are of concern because there is no canonical way to specify the behavior of `unselect` at a 
 * conflicted hole.  Instead, a [[com.codecommit.antixml.ZipperMergeStrategy]], implicitly provided
 * to `unselect`, is used to resolve the conflict.
 *
 * A default ZipperMergeStrategy has been provided that should suffice for the most common use cases involving
 * conflicted holes.  In particular, if modifications to a conflicted element are limited to its top-level properties 
 * (`name`, `attributes`, etc.), then the default strategy will apply those changes while preserving any modifications 
 * made to those descendant nodes also present in the Zipper.  However, if the `children` property of a conflicted element
 * is directly modified, then the default strategy's behavior is formally unspecified.  Currently it uses a heuristic 
 * algorithm to resolve conflicts, but its details may change in a future release.
 *
 * Of the [[com.codecommit.antixml.Selectable]] operators, only `\\` is capable of producing conflicts.  
 * The `select`, `\`, and `\\!` operators always produce conflict-free Zippers.
 *
 * ====Unselection Algorithm====
 * 
 * Let G be a group, and Z be a zipper with G as its parent.  For each location, L, in G (top-level or otherwise), we make
 * the following definitions:
 * 
 *  - G(L) is the node in G at location L.
 *  - `children`(L) is the sequence of locations that are immediately below L in G. 
 *  - L is a ''hole'' if it is in Z's "holes" set.
 *  - L is ''above a hole'' if some descendant of L is a hole.
 *  - If L is a hole, the ''direct updates'' for L is the sequence of nodes given by the inverse of Z's replacement map,
 *  in the order defined by Z.
 *  - For any L, The ''indirect update'' for L is just G(L) with its children replaced by `children`(L)`.flatMap(pullback)`.
 *  - For any L, `pullback`(L) is the sequence of nodes given by the following recursive definition:
 *    - If L is not a hole, then `pullback`(L) is the singleton sequence consisting of the indirect update for L
 *    - If L is a hole, but is not above a hole, then `pullback`(L) is the direct updates for L.
 *    - Otherwise, L is conflicted and `pullback`(L) is the result of merging its direct updates and its
 *    indirect update according to the [[com.codecommit.antixml.ZipperMergeStrategy]] provided to `unselect`.
 *
 * Let T be the sequence of top-level locations in G.  Then `Z.unselect` is defined as `T.flatMap(pullback)`.
 *
