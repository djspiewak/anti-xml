/** A zipper which allows deep selection.
 *
 * ==Unselection Algorithm==
 * 
 * Let G be a group, and Z be a zipper with G as its parent.  For each node, N, in G (top-level or otherwise), we make
 * the following definitions:
 * 
 *  - N ''lies in'' Z if N was matched by the original selection operation that led to the creation the zipper.
 *  - N ''lies above'' Z if a descendant of N lies in Z
 *  - For any N that lies in Z, the ''direct updates'' for N are the sequence of nodes that replaced N via update operations on the zipper.
 *  - For any N that lies above Z, the ''indirect update'' for N is just N with its children flatMapped with the pullback function (defined below).
 *  - The ''pullback'' of N consists of a sequence of nodes as defined below:
 *    - If N does not lie in Z, then the pullback of N is the singleton sequence consisting of the indirect update for N
 *    - If N lies in Z, but does not lie above Z, then the pullback of N is its direct updates. 
 *    - If N lies in Z ''and'' lies above Z, then the pullback of N is the result of merging its direct updates and its indirect update,
 * according to the [[com.codecommit.antixml.ZipperMergeStrategy]] passed as an implicit parameter to `unselect`.
 *
 * (Strictly speaking, these definitions should be made on the location of N in G rather than on N itself, but we abuse the
 * terminology for the sake of brevity)
 *
 * With the above definitions, the result of `unselect` can be defined simply as G flatMapped with the pullBack function.
 * 
 * The last line in the definition of "pullback" deserves special mention because it defines the only condition under which
 * the [[com.codecommit.antixml.ZipperMergeStrategy]] is invoked. Given zipper Z and parent G, if there exists an N in G such that N lies both in and above Z, 
 * then Z is said to be ''conflicted at N''.  A zipper without such an N then Z is said to be ''conflict free'' and will never invoke
 * a ZipperMergeStrategy during unselection.
