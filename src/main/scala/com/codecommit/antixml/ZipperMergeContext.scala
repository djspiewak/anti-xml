/**
 * Describes the parameters of a merge operation.  
 * 
 * The purpose of a merge 
 *
 * Operations such as `flatMap` make it possible for a zipper's node to be replaced by multiple nodes or to be removed altogether.  For this
 * reason, direct updates are represented as a ''sequence'' of nodes.  In contrast, the indirect update always consists of a single node.  
 * Any multiplicative operations that occurred further down the tree will will already have been accounted for in that node's children. 
 * 
 * @param original the original Node that was selected when the zipper was produced.
 * @param directUpdate the direct replacements of the node and their corresponding update times. These are the nodes
 * that explicitly replaced `original` via updates to its position in the zipper.
 * @param lastDirectUpdate the largest update time of any direct update to the node.  If `directUpdates` is empty, this
 * will be the time that the node was removed. 
 * @param indirectUpdate the "indirect" replacement and associated update time.  The indirect replacement is just the
 * original node with its children replaced by a recursive application of the unselection algorithm, as defined in the 
 * [[com.codecommit.antixml.DeepZipper]] unselection algorithm.
