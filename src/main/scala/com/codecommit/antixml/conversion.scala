/**
 * Pimp container for the explicit conversions into Anti-XML types.  Out of the
 * box, conversions are provided from `scala.xml` types.  However, this mechanism
 * is very extensible due to the use of a typeclass ([[com.codecommit.antixml.XMLConvertable]])
 * to represent the actual conversion.  Thus, it is possible to add conversions
 * by defining an implicit instance of the typeclass and having it in scope.  It
 * is even possible to override the built-in conversions for `scala.xml` types
 * simply by shadowing the conversions for types like [[scala.xml.Elem]].  The
 * built-in conversions are defined in such a way that Scala's implicit resolution
 * will give precedence to almost anything you define, as long as it is somehow
 * in scope.

/**
 * Typeclass definition for conversions used by the [[com.codecommit.antixml.Converter]] pimp.
 * Note that this type is ''exactly'' isomorphic to [[scala.Function1]], right
 * down to the method name (`apply`).  Normally, such a class would in fact extend
 * `A => B`, rather than simply emulating its interface.  However, because most
 * instances of `XMLConvertable` will be implicit, we cannot blithely extend
 * `Function1`.  To do so would polute the scope with an unexpected proliferation
 * of ''implicit'' conversions which would be automatically injected by the Scala
 * compiler, rather than allowing us to tag them ''explicitly'' using the `convert` method.
 * 
 * @see [[com.codecommit.antixml.Converter]]

/**
 * Contains the built-in explicit conversions into Anti-XML.  Currently, these
 * conversions only cover types in `scala.xml`.  This may be expanded in future.
 *
 * All of the members in this object are implicit, and thus it is rare for a user
 * to need to access them directly.  The membership is contrived in such a way
 * that the implicit resolution will use the following precedence order:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>`ElemConvertable`</li>
 * <li>`TextConvertable`</li>
 * <li>`EntityRefConvertable`</li>
 * <li>`NodeConvertable`</li>
 * <li>`NodeSeqConvertable`</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * This corresponds with the roughly-intuitive conversion precedence.  Thus, if
 * we have a value of type [[scala.xml.Elem]] and we invoke the `anti` method on
 * that value, the result will be of type [[com.codecommit.antixml.Elem]].  However,
 * if we take that same value and ascribe it the type of [[scala.xml.Node]],
 * the `anti` method will return a value of type [[com.codecommit.antixml.Node]].
 * Finally, we can take this same value and ascribe it the even less-specific type
 * of [[scala.xml.NodeSeq]] (or even [[scala.Seq]]`[`[[scala.xml.Node]]`]`, for
 * that matter).  Invoking the `anti` method on this maximally-widened type will
 * produce a value of type [[com.codecommit.antixml.Group]]`[`[[com.codecommit.antixml.Node]]`]`.
 * Thus, the most specific conversion is chosen in all cases.
