/**
 * Root of the `Node` ADT, representing the different types of supported XML
 * nodes which may appear in an XML fragment.  The ADT itself has the following
 * shape (Haskell syntax):
 *
 * {{{
 * data Node = ProcInstr String String
 *           | Elem QName Attributes (Map String String) (Group Node)
 *           | Text String
 *           | CDATA String
 *           | EntityRef String
 * }}}
 *
 * For those that don't find Haskell to be the clearest explanation of what's
 * going on in this type, here is a more natural-language version.  The `Node`
 * trait is sealed and has exactly four subclasses, each implementing a different
 * type of XML node.  These four classes are as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>[[com.codecommit.antixml.ProcInstr]] – A processing instruction consisting
 * of a target and some data</li>
 * <li>[[com.codecommit.antixml.Elem]] – An XML element consisting of an optional
 * namespace, a name (or identifier), a set of attributes and a sequence of child nodes</li>
 * <li>[[com.codecommit.antixml.Text]] – A node containing a single string, representing
 * character data in the XML tree</li>
 * <li>[[com.codecommit.antixml.CDATA]] – A node containing a single string, representing
 * ''unescaped'' character data in the XML tree</li>
 * <li>[[com.codecommit.antixml.EntityRef]] – An entity reference (e.g. `&amp;`)</li>
 * </ul>
