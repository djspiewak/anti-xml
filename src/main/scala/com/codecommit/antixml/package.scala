/**
 * Base package for the Anti-XML framework.  Note that importing this package
 * brings in a number of implicit conversions.  Specifically:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>`String => Selector[Elem, Zipper[Elem]]` – Used to allow string-based
 * selection syntax with [[com.codecommit.antixml.Group]].  (e.g. `ns \ "name"`)</li>
 * <li>`Symbol => Selector[Elem, Zipper[Elem]]` – Used to allow symbol-based
 * selection syntax with [[com.codecommit.antixml.Group]].  (e.g. `ns \ 'name`)</li>
 * <li>∀`A` . `A => Converter[A]` – Implements ''explicit'' conversions from
 * `scala.xml` types to Anti-XML correspondents (where applicable).  This
 * technically makes the `anti` method available on all types.  However, that
 * method will only be callable on very specific types in the `scala.xml`
 * library, and thus it shouldn't cause any collsion issues.</li>
 * <li>`(String, String) => (QName, String)` – Required to get nice syntax for
 * unqualified attribute names.  Note there is an additional conversion of type
 * `String => QName`, but that conversion is defined on the companion object for
 * [[com.codecommit.antixml.QName]], which prevents it from cluttering the dispatch
 * implicit space (i.e. it only applies as a type coercion, ''not'' a pimp).</li>
 * </ul>
