/**
 * An immutable `Map` specialization that guarantees its iteration order.
 *
 * Loosely speaking, an OrderPreservingMap's iteration order is the order in which its keys where "added" to the map.
 * Merely changing the value of a key does not alter its position in the iteration order.
 *
 * More precisely, Given an OrderPreservingMap, `map` and items `k` and `v`:
 *
 * * If `map.isDefinedAt(k)` then:
 * ** The iteration order of `map + (k,v)` is the same as that of `map` with `(k,v)` taking the place of `(k,map(k))`.
 * ** The iteration order of `map - k` is the same as that of `map` with `(k,map(k))` elided.
 * * Otherwise:
 * ** The iteration order of `map + (k,v)` is the same as that of `map` followed by `(k,v)`.
 * ** The iteration order of `map - k` is the same as that of `map`.
 * 
 * The behavior of other map operations with respect to order is derived from the above rules in the natural way.
 *
 * The `OrderPreservingMap` companion object provides factory methods for creating general-purpose OrderPreservingMaps.
