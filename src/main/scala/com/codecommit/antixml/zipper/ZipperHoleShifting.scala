  /** Shifts the focus of the zipper to another set of holes.
   *
   *  The shifting is performed using a shifting function which is applied to each
   *  path visible in the zipper and produces a new sequence of paths.
   *  These paths are sorted lexicographically and duplicates are removed.
   *
   *  A new zipper displaying the above paths is returned while internally maintaining data
   *  about any previously contained paths.
   *
   *  The values which are attached to the paths come from two sources:
   *  - If the zipper previously contained the path, the data attached to it is used.
   *  - If the path is new, the data is fetched directly from the parent of the zipper.
   *
   *  In case a hole was previously multiplied (e.g. using flatMap) it is placed
   *  as is in the resulting zipper.
   *
   *  Note: shifting is not supported for parentless (broken) zippers.
   *
   *  @param shiftFunc A function to be supplied with the parent of the zipper
   *  and applied to the indexed contents of the zipper.
   *  Assumed to produce valid paths with regard to the supplied parent.
